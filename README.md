# Image Understanding
  My last homework for Image Understanding lecture.
  First part is about Image Processing and Feature Detection following code is in detect and match.py. OpenCV is used for feature detection and descriptor computation.
 Second part is about RANSAC following code is in ransac.py. OpenCV is used for homography computation with RANSAC.
 Last part is about Basic Stitching following code is in stitch.py. OpenCV is used for function warp perspective for image warping.
